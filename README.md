# The Sun

This project was started on Monday, 24 August, 2015.

It's an unsolicited redesign for The Sun Newspaper's website, mainly as an exercise for me to improve on my WordPress chops.

It's designed by Martyn Hullett and coded by [Anwar Choukah][3] and is based on [BlankSlate][1] by [TidyThemes][2]
